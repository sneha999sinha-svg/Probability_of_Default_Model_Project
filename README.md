# Probability_of_Default_Model_Project
Built an end-to-end Probability of Default (PD) model to assess borrower-level credit risk using financial and behavioral variables. Evaluated model discrimination using AUC-ROC and identified key default drivers through feature importance, aligning with bank underwriting and regulatory credit risk frameworks.
